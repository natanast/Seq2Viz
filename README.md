# Seq2Viz

**Seq2Viz** is a Shiny application for quick visualization of RNA-seq differential expression results generated by DESeq2.  
It allows users to upload DESeq2 output files and metadata, and quickly generate publication-quality visualizations such as volcano plots and PCA plots.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natanast/Seq2Viz.git
```

## Required packages
```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib", "shinyWidgets", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

## Usage
```r
library(shiny)
runApp("R/main.R")
```

## Input Data Requirements

To use Seq2Viz, provide the following datasets:

1. **DESeq2 results file**  
   - Must contain at least the following columns: `Geneid`, `pvalue`, `padj`.
2. **Gene counts file**  
   - Must contain a `gene_name` column with gene identifiers.

3. **Sample metadata file**  
   - Must contain `sampleID`, `patientID`, and `Group1` columns.


## How to Use This App
1. Upload your datasets under the **`Upload files`** tab.
2. Explore sample clustering and relationships in the **`PCA Plot`** tab.
3. Visualize differential expression in the **`Volcano Plot`** and **`Heatmap`** tabs. .
4. Explore pathway enrichment with the **`ORA`**  and **`GSEA`** tabs.


## Test Data

To help you try the app quickly, example files are included in `example_data/`. 

**Files**
- `example_data/deseq2_treatment_vs_control.xlsx` — DESeq2 results
- `example_data/gene_counts_deseq2_normalized.txt` — normalized counts
- `example_data/sample_metadata.xlsx` — sample annotations

**How to try**
1. Launch the app (see **Usage** above).  
2. Go to **`Upload files`** and select the three files from `example_data/`.  
3. Open **`PCA Plot`** (you should see two groups) and **`Volcano Plot`** (a small set of DE genes).

**Current coverage**
- ✅ PCA Plot  
- ✅ Volcano Plot  
- ⏳ Heatmap (coming soon)
